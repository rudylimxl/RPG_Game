Building a browser RPG Game inspired by one of my favorite title of all time, Slay the Spire.

The game is built completely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
DOM manipulation is used to render elements and perform actions on the page.

## Game Design Philosophy: <br>

A 'roguelike' game genre focuses on replayability. Instead of building long story line with characters getting stronger over multiple hours (or tens of hours) of gameplay, roguelike games cycle lasts 20mins-1hr, with character resetting over a short game progression.
